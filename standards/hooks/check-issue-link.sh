# Agentic policy check (S2 C-3): commits pushed on a feat/sprint-* branch must carry a
# "Refs: owner/repo#N" trailer linking the GitHub issue the commit implements. Escape hatch:
# a "No-Issue: <reason>" trailer. See docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-26-intent-achievement-
# spine-design.md (menger-toplevel) — closes audit findings C4/D2/F2 (findings had no stable
# ID; the fidelity check had no referent; checkpoint decisions evaporated).

# usage: check-issue-link.sh <rev-range> [<rev-range>...]
