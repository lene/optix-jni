# --- pre-push change detection ----------------------------------------------
#
# git runs pre-push with "<local_ref> <local_sha> <remote_ref> <remote_sha>" lines
# on stdin. Three invocation contexts have to work, and testing only whether stdin
# is a terminal distinguishes just two of them:
#
#   real push          stdin is a pipe carrying the ref lines -> use them
#   manual, terminal   stdin is a TTY -> must NOT read; `read` would block waiting
#                      for a human. Compare the branch against origin/main instead.
#   manual, no TTY     an agent, script or CI job. stdin is empty and closed, so
#                      `read` hits EOF immediately and yields nothing -> also fall
#                      back to comparing against origin/main.
#
# The third case is the trap. `[ -t 0 ]` is false there, so a hook that treats
# "not a TTY" as "git gave me refs" takes the protocol branch, reads nothing, and
# hands every caller an empty change set. The caller then skips all its checks and
# exits 0 — a false pass that is indistinguishable from a clean run. That is how a
# push containing CI-config changes sailed through the gate untested.
#
# So the TTY test stays, but only as a hang guard: what makes this correct is the
# fallback when the read produces nothing. Do not "simplify" this back into a
# single [ -t 0 ] branch.
#
# Emits "<base>..<local_sha>" ranges, one per line.
# Returns 2 when the push only deletes a branch, so callers can exit deliberately.
